#  Metacode

## Overview

Metacode is a blockchain-based system designed for secure data sharing. It utilizes cryptographic techniques, including Shamir Secret Sharing for request transmission and Pro-ORAM for data storage. The system is engineered to protect metadata and ensure robustness against up to nâˆ’1 malicious servers, making it an ideal choice for environments requiring high security and data integrity.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Based Secure Sharing**: Leverages blockchain technology for secure and transparent data transactions.
- **Shamir Secret Sharing**: Implements Shamir Secret Sharing for secure request transmission, enhancing privacy and security.
- **Pro-ORAM for Data Storage**: Utilizes Pro-ORAM (Oblivious RAM) for efficient and secure data storage, protecting against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Robust Against Malicious Servers**: Designed to be resilient against a high number of malicious servers, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

Download and extract the Metacode package to your desired directory.

## Usage

The system consists of various Python modules, each serving a specific function in the Metacode framework:

- `main.py`: The main script to run the Metacode system.
- `config.py`: Contains configuration settings for the system.
- `crypto.py`: Implements cryptographic functions and utilities.
- `init.py`: Initializes the system and sets up necessary parameters.
- `nodes.py`: Defines the node structure and interactions within the blockchain.
- `proxy.py`: Manages proxy functionalities for data requests and responses.
- `shuffle.py`: Handles data shuffling to enhance security.
- `target.py`: Target module for data storage and retrieval.
- `test.py`: Contains tests for validating the functionality of the system.

To start the Metacode system, run the `main.py` script:

```python
python main.py
```

## Testing

Run the `test.py` script to perform unit tests and ensure the system is functioning correctly:

```python
python test.py
```
